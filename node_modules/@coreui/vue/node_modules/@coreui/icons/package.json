CoreUI Icons are beautifully crafted symbols for common actions and items. You can use them in your digital products for web or mobile app.\n\n![CoreUI Free Icons](https://coreui.io/images/icons_free_bg_set.png)\n\n## Preview & Docs\n\n[https://coreui.io/icons/](https://coreui.io/icons/)\n\n\n## Installation\n\n### CDN\n\n```html\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://unpkg.com/@coreui/icons/css/all.min.css\">\n```\n\nor \n\n```html\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://unpkg.com/@coreui/icons/css/free.min.css\">\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://unpkg.com/@coreui/icons/css/brand.min.css\">\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://unpkg.com/@coreui/icons/css/flag.min.css\">\n```\n\n### NPM\n\n```shell\nnpm install @coreui/icons --save\n```\n\n### Yarn\n\n```shell\nyarn add @coreui/icons\n```\n\nOr, you can also clone or [download this repository](https://github.com/coreui/coreui-icons/archive/master.zip) as zip.\n\n## Usage\n\n### Basic Use\nYou can place CoreUI Icons just about anywhere using a CSS style prefix and the icon’s name. CoreUI Icons are designed to be used with inline elements ex. `<i>` or `<span>`.\n\nPlease use `cil-` prefix for linear icons, `cib-` prefix for brand icons, and `cif-` prefix for flag icons.\n\n```html\n<i class=\"cil-energy\"></i>\n```\n\n```html\n<i class=\"cib-twitter\"></i>\n```\n\n```html\n<i class=\"cif-us\"></i>\n```\n\n### SVG Sprites\n\nSVG sprites let you quickly use vector icons in your website. We have prepared all the icon set styles into their own SVG sprites.\n\nPlace sprite files with the rest of your static files, like images and styles, in your project. Make sure to add a proper path to the SVG sprite file, and use the fragment identifier specific to the SVG icon or symbol you want to display.\n\n```html\n<svg>\n  <use xlink:href=\"path/to/free.svg#cil-airplane-mode\"></use>\n</svg>\n<svg>\n  <use xlink:href=\"path/to/brand.svg#cib-twitter\"></use>\n</svg>\n<svg>\n  <use xlink:href=\"path/to/flag.svg#cif-uss\"></use>\n</svg>\n```\n\n\n### SVG Symbols\n\nWhen you download your icon set, it comes with a sprites directory that contains SVG icon definitions. These icons can be referenced and used as inline SVGs like so:\n\n```html\n<!-- Define the symbols -->\n<symbol id=\"cil-apple\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\">\n<title>apple</title>\n<path d=\"M21.207 9.987c-0.497-1.275-1.29-2.262-2.293-2.863-0.25 0.477-0.524 0.888-0.835 1.267l0.010-0.013c0.002 0.001 0.004 0.002 0.005 0.003 1.494 0.859 2.364 3.054 2.114 5.338-0.414 3.784-1.563 6.377-3.236 7.302-1.087 0.601-2.444 0.516-4.031-0.254l-0.155-0.075h-1.143l-0.155 0.075c-1.588 0.77-2.944 0.856-4.031 0.254-1.673-0.925-2.822-3.518-3.236-7.302-0.25-2.284 0.619-4.479 2.114-5.338 0.445-0.259 0.979-0.411 1.549-0.411 0.011 0 0.023 0 0.034 0l-0.002-0c1.132 0 2.436 0.53 3.853 1.578l0.051 0.037s2.043-0.248 2.852-0.616c2.439-1.107 2.976-2.867 3.072-3.106 0.262-0.632 0.414-1.366 0.414-2.135 0-0.813-0.17-1.587-0.476-2.287l0.014 0.037-0.191-0.477-0.513 0.005c-3.151 0.036-5.692 2.598-5.692 5.755 0 0.255 0.017 0.507 0.049 0.754l-0.003-0.029c-0.886-0.496-1.747-0.813-2.573-0.944-1.169-0.186-2.241-0.005-3.186 0.538-1.038 0.596-1.855 1.601-2.364 2.906-0.463 1.186-0.638 2.57-0.493 3.895 0.475 4.344 1.859 7.267 4.001 8.452 0.655 0.37 1.438 0.588 2.272 0.588 0.010 0 0.021-0 0.031-0h-0.002c0.918-0 1.904-0.244 2.952-0.73h0.461c1.987 0.923 3.754 0.971 5.253 0.142 2.142-1.185 3.526-4.107 4.001-8.452 0.145-1.325-0.030-2.709-0.493-3.895zM15.376 2.851c0.322-0.143 0.697-0.251 1.088-0.305l0.022-0.003c0.106 0.354 0.167 0.761 0.167 1.182 0 2.15-1.593 3.927-3.663 4.215l-0.022 0.003c-0.106-0.354-0.167-0.76-0.167-1.181 0-1.743 1.048-3.242 2.547-3.901l0.027-0.011z\"></path>\n</symbol>\n\n<!-- Use the defined symbols -->\n<svg>\n  <use xlink:href=\"#cil-apple\"></use>\n</svg>\n```\n\nIt is also possible to link to an external SVG containing the definitions:\n\n```html\n<svg class=\"icon-home\">\n  <use xlink:href=\"path/to/free-symbol-defs.svg#cil-apple\"></use>\n</svg>\n```\n\nReferencing an external SVG has the advantage that your icons get cached, with one HTTP request. But the external SVG and the HTML should be served from the same domain. This approach works fine in modern browsers except for IE 9+. In order to support IE 9+, You should use `/js/svgxuse.js` or `/js/svgxuse.min.js`. This polyfill detects if the icons are loaded properly; if they aren't, it sends one HTTP request to fetch and cache symbol definitions.\n\n```html\n<script defer src=\"https://unpkg.com/@coreui/icons/js/svgxuse.js\"></script>\n```\n\n## CoreUI Icons PRO\n\nIf our free icon set is insufficient you can buy [CoreUI Icons Pro](https://coreui.io/icons/pro/) with more than 2000 icons, and more styles - Solid, Duo-Tone and Linear.\n\n## License\n\n### CoreUI Icons Free Icons\n\nCoreUI Icons Free is free, open source, and GPL friendly.

These owners may\ncontribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the\nfurther production of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain\nreputation or greater distribution for their Work in part through the use and\nefforts of others.\n\nFor these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation\nof additional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a\nWork (the \"Affirmer\"), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright\nand Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work\nand publicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her\nCopyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal\neffect of CC0 on those rights.\n\n1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be\nprotected by copyright and related or neighboring rights (\"Copyright and\nRelated Rights\"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited\nto, the following:\n\n  i. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate,\n  and translate a Work;\n\n  ii. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);\n\n  iii. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or likeness\n  depicted in a Work;\n\n  iv. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,\n  subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;\n\n  v. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in\n  a Work;\n\n  vi. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the\n  European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal\n  protection of databases, and under any national implementation thereof,\n  including any amended or successor version of such directive); and\n\n  vii. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world\n  based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations thereof.\n\n2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of,\napplicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and\nunconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer's Copyright\nand Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now\nknown or unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of\naction), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum\nduration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time\nextensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of\ncopies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation\ncommercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the \"Waiver\").
